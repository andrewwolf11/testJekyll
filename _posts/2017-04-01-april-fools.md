Did you get pranked on April Fools?

I sure did.

I woke up at 7am that day. It was cluody and misty. I made my coffee and went about my morning routine, when suddenly I got a phone call from my fraternity brother. He said that I needed to go to the bio lab to help him carry some stuff- so I walked over. When I walked out of my building, the first person I saw had underwear on his head. I thought how strange- I kept walking and I saw other people with strange articles of clothing on their heads- socks, leggings, mittens. Eventually I got the nerve to ask what was going on- and they said April Fools!
